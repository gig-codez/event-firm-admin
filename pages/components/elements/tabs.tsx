                                        not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature
                                        from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor
                                        at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin
                                        words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of
                                        the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum
                                        comes from sections.
